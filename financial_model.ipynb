    "The advent of technology and the ability to stream or download digital music in the early 2000's, with platforms such as Napster and Apple ushering in a new paradigm of distribution, brought with it a moral question to listeners, to buy or pirate. It seems that the reality present is that music listeners now feel that music should be free, as the next 20 years saw revenues drop steadily. Companies like Spotify have been moderately successful at collecting the pieces of a shattered informational property based industry by making it possible to spend a few pennies each year and gain access to 611 billion streamable songs. Though there is a great population of people tallying up on average about 32 hours of listening per week each, low costs for a huge library has Apple Music only paying $0.00437 per stream (see below). The artists making a living off of their contributions to cultural and mental wellbeing of the world have had to certainly make the most of other income streams if they aren't somewhere near the top."

    "One of the biggest problems with this system of a per-stream payout is that on all platforms, the play of a Taylor Swift song is worth the same as a play of a musician who only reaches '<1000' plays for most of their songs. What Mobius seeks to do is appropriately divert income to artists that are creating high quality music by allowing listeners to more accurately decide where their yearly investment in the music industry goes. The system invisioned creates an incentive for artists to create more cheap merchandise that can be purchased to establish consumers as platform-recognized 'fans'. The thought being that a greater monetary and exposure-based profit margin is found in physical merchandise rather than number of plays, especially for creators with smaller audiences bound to a more limited geographic presence. \n",
    "\n",
    "This 'fan' status earns streaming priveledges for an artist-decided time period (upon registering through Mobius, we will be sending economic reports including business suggestions derived using machine learning algorithms and comparisons amongst the varying market climates). The vision is that after a certain number of, again artist distinguished, checkpoints, the fan gains eternal access to the streaming library of that artist, along with the merchandise, concert experiences and digital downloads that 'earned' a publicly represented 'fan' status. Looking generally shows that a fan needs to spend a minimum to earn access to the library for life, whether an artist decides to gift downloads of their collection conditionally is entirely up to their business--knowing that offline/out-of-service/battery-saving-airplane-mode listening is a critical to many consumers.
